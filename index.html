            <h2>Here's a timeline of Steve Jobs and his professional career:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1955-</strong> His parents, two university students without material means to support him, gave little Steve up for adoption to the couple formed by Paul and Clara Jobs (railway driver and housewife, respectively).</li>
                <li><strong>1971-</strong> After finishing high school, he entered Reed College, a liberal arts university located in Portland, Oregon, but dropped out a semester later. At that time he flirted with drugs and became interested in philosophy and counterculture, traveling to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. After an internship at Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, Jobs was hired as a designer by Atari,</li>
                <li><strong>1971-</strong> He met Steve Wozniak with whom Apple was later founded.</li>
                <li><strong>1975-</strong> Start attending meetings at the "Homebrew Computer Club", a place for personal computer lovers.</li>
                <li><strong>1976-</strong> Jobs and Wozniak manage to raise $1,750 and build their first personal computer, the Apple I. It was the first computer with an integrated video interface, internal read-only memory (ROM) and that loaded programs from external sources.</li>
                <li><strong>1976-</strong> Founded Apple Computer Company with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Wayne will sell his stake in it just two weeks later.</li>
                <li><strong>1977-</strong> Apple is renamed Apple Computer Inc. and the new company purchases the original property.</li>
                <li><strong>1977-</strong> The Apple II, an improvement on the previous model, was introduced in 1977, becoming the first mass-market computer. Apple became the fastest growing company in the United States. Three years later, Apple went public with a price of $22 per share, making Jobs and Wozniak millionaires. Steve Jobs had already acquired his reputation as a two-faced genius, gifted in technology and business.</li>
                <li><strong>1981-</strong> Apple's strongest competitor, IBM, released its first personal computer, largely copying the specifications of the Apple II that Apple itself, somewhat naively, had made public. Steve Jobs decided to recruit the president of the multinational soft drink company Pepsi, John Sculley, to the management of Apple, without imagining that he would end up firing him from his own company.</li>
                <li><strong>1985-</strong> Problems began between Jobs and Wozniak. The result of these personal conflicts was that Wozniak left Apple in 1985, the year in which 1,200 employees were laid off as a result of an extensive restructuring in the company, and Jobs resigned (abandoned) to undertake alone a new business journey.</li>
                <li><strong>1986-</strong> Jobs founded a new computer company, NeXT Computer, and purchased the animation division of the filmmaker's production company, Lucasfilm Limited, for ten million dollars. Thus, Pixar Animation Studios was born in 1986, focused on the computer production of animated films; Just three years later, one of the films made by the studios, Tin Toy (1988), won the Academy Award for best animated short film.</li>
                <li><strong>1996-</strong> Defeated in its lawsuits against Microsoft and plunged into a deep crisis, Apple decided to buy NeXT Computer, which marked the return of Steve Jobs to the company with a position of interim advisor (for which Jobs, voluntarily, did not receive any salary). Nine months later, the president of Apple put Jobs in charge of the company.</li>
                <li><strong>1997-</strong> A month before his appointment as interim president of Apple, Jobs announced an agreement with the rival corporation, Microsoft, which decided to invest $150 million in Apple. The two companies ended up understanding that they needed and complemented each other.</li>
                <li><strong>1998-</strong> Steve Jobs once again revolutionized the computer market with the launch of the iMac, a compact computer integrated into the monitor, which in addition to its spectacular avant-garde design was prepared for surfing the Internet. Its sales success placed Apple once again among the five largest personal computer manufacturers in the United States.</li>
                <li><strong>2001-</strong> Jobs went on to deploy his inexhaustible inventiveness in other areas, combining, as he had always done, innovative functionalities with maximum simplicity of use and elegant minimalist designs. The first was digital music: with a pocket audio player, the iPod, and two years later he created the iTunes music store, which immediately led the sale of online music and continues to maintain its dominant position.</li>
                <li><strong>2004-</strong> His health problems forced him to temporarily step away from his job in 2004, the year he was treated for pancreatic cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>2007-</strong> In 2007 it introduced the iPhone, the first in the family of high-end smartphones produced by Apple. Declared "invention of the year" by Time magazine</li>
                <li><strong>2008-</strong> App Store in July 2008, an application store where all types of developers could sell software designed for iPhones and other devices manufactured by the company.</li>
                <li><strong>2009-</strong> Steve Jobs had to undergo a liver transplant, so he delegated most of his responsibilities to Timothy Cook. But not even the visible deterioration of his health would reduce his dedication to work and his innovative desire.</li>
                <li><strong>2010-</strong> With his creativity intact, still in 2010 he surprised the world with the iPad, a hybrid of tablet and mobile phone; A light and very thin 9.7-inch touch screen contained the processing power and all the features of a laptop on its back, without the need for a keyboard or mouse.</li>
                <li><strong>2011-</strong> Jobs presented the second version, the iPad 2, in March 2011, in what would be one of his last public appearances. On October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, he died at his home in Palo Alto, a victim of the progression of cancer that had been detected in 2003.</li>
            </ul>
